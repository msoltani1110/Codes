# Instructions for using the files in this repository
1. Run the code named "StochKit_trend_generator" in StochKit2 software. Please refer to the Stochkit2 software manual (https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/StochKit/StochKitUserGuide.ps) for details on how to run a code in StochKit2. 
2. Make a time trend using this code and save the trajectory, i.e., while running the simulation, your command should have a part that looks something like:
"-t 50000 -r 1 -i 500000 --keep-trajectories"
3. After creating time trend using StockKit2, please see the instructions in the MATLAB code named "data_extractor_from_simulations"
