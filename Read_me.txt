1- Run the code named "StochKit_trend_generator" in StochKit2 software
2- Please see the Stochkit2 software manual for running a code in StochKit2. 
3- Make a time trend using this code and save the trajectory, i.e. in running simulation your command should have a part similar to "-t 50000 -r 1 -i 500000 --keep-trajectories"
4- After creating time trend by using StockKit2, please see the instructions in the MATLAB code named "data_extractor_from_simulations"
